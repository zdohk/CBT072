%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +

   You can select one or more elements for processing from the element selection
   list by entering any valid line command in front of each element name. You
   can use the cursor control keys to position the cursor on the desired lines.
   Any of the functions described on the primary PANEXEC library utility panel
   may be used as line commands on an element selection list. Any line commands
   entered, however, will be ignored if a primary command is entered.

   When an element is renamed (R), promoted (PM), copied (C), deleted (D), or
   has its mode modified (M) the element selection list is updated by adding
   and/or deleting the element name. The other statistics, however, are not
   updated until the element selection list is re-displayed.
