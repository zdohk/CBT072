%TUTORIAL -------------- PANEXEC GLOBAL FACILITIES--------------------- TUTORIAL
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +

+  The PANEXEC global facilities are:
     PANEXEC LOADER
     DYNAMIC BLDL
     PDS COMPATIBILITY (CICS)
     SECURITY EXIT MANAGER

+  These facilities are described in detail in the PANEXEC SYSTEM REFERENCE
   MANUAL in Chapter 10 'INSTALLATION' (P. 10-16 thru 10-39) and will not be
   further discussed in this tutorial except to clarify the operation of this
   PANEXEC/ISPF panel. The panel requires that a JOB statement be completed
   since the global facilities functions are executed as a batch job.

   The global facilities panel should be accessibile only to your systems
   programming staff for the purpose of activating/deactivating or modifying
   any of the above facilities. This requires that the systems programmer be
   aware of the options chosen in the PANEOPT macro when PANEXEC was installed.

   To activate/deactivate/report on ALL PANEXEC global facilities simply
   enter the A/D/R option on the command line.  (Be sure to quiese the
   system prior to deactivating PANEXEC).
