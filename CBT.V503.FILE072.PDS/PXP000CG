   When utilizing the S (display element selection list) option there are
   several performance issues which must be taken into account.  By the
   very nature of the PANEXEC library structure, access to the entire
   PANEXEC directory may require a considerable amount of system resources
   (especially I/O) which may cause unacceptable delays in displaying
   element selection lists. This is especially true for PANEXEC libraries
   containing many elements (over several hundred) and will depend on the
   scope of the element selection list requested and the particular
   PANEXEC primary commands issued from the element selection list.

   For this reason, the DISPLAY VIEW field has been incorporated into the
   primary PANEXEC utility panel. When the Short (S) option is chosen (the
   default), the element selection list will be displayed relatively
   quickly, even for large PANEXEC libraries. However, NO source PANVALET
   information will be displayed for executable elements even when there is
   PANVALET information contained in the directory for those elements. In
   order to display all PANVALET source information in the element
   selection list panel the Long (L) option of DISPLAY VIEW field must be
   chosen, but users are cautioned that this option adds a very significant
   amount of overhead in displaying the element selection list.
